The increasing brain size meme with the title: Low latency classification task and then options being use k-NN, use neural network, increase neural network size, add dense connections, etc, then the final one is use k-NN 

Non-neural network ML, for faster inference (k means, cart, k nn, bagging, boosting, others?) compare cart and k nn with a NN on some cool animal/flower dataset maybe?
